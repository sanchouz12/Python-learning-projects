There are the folowing projects:
--------------------------------
1. Simple console calculator
* You can calculate integers and fractions
2. Console movie app
* You can add, find and see your movies
3. App with files
* This app is for practicing using files
4. Console library
* You can add and delete a book, mark it as read, see all books
* Data can't be lost, because it's saved into a file (of course, if you don't delete the file)
* Using custom errors to check, if file has required (or any at all) content (I don't know, if this errors are useful, but I made them)
