# Python learning projects

There are some small Python projects, that I created to practice some technologies or to save some useful features.

## Projects

### Simple console calculator

You can calculate integers and fractions.

### Console movie app

You can add, find and see list of your movies.

### App with files

This app is for practicing using files.

### Wery simple logger

It might be useful.

### Decorators templates

Just to remember.

### Simple Flask API

It has no architecture principles.

### Mathplotlib random walk

It consists of 2 visualization examples: graph of squares and graph of random walk.

### Pygal dice rolling visualization

This project visualises frequency of rolling results in a hystogram, that's saved in an .svg file.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repository or download archive 
```
git clone https://github.com/sanchouz12/Python-learning-projects
```
2. If in the folder you find **"requirements.txt"** file, this project requires some libraries. It's better to create new virtual environment, then install libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Inside of each folder you'll find a Python .py files. To launch them open terminal from that folder and type
```
python <file name>.py
```

### Prerequisites

You'll need an installed Python 3.x and it's recommended for some projects to create fresh virtual environment.
